# Project CutFitt_URL
 In today's world, it is important to keep things as short as possible, this is what inspires the team at CutFitt_URL to come up with something as unique as a url shortening app to make all your long URL's as short as possible. STILL IN PROGRESS...

## About
CutFitt-URL is a URL shortening service that allows you to shorten any URL to a more manageable and user-friendly link. CutFitt-URL helps you to create branded short links to share your brand identity, custom slugs and domain customization options to reinforce your brand presence and enhance user engagement.


## Features
- URL Shortning: CutFitt_URLs allows users to shorten URLs by pasting a long URL into the CutFitt_URL platform and a shorter URL gets automatically generated. The shortened URL is designed to be as short as possible, making it easy to share on social media or through other channels.
- Custom URLs: CutFitt_URL also allows users to customize their shortened URLs. Users can choose their own custom domain name and customize the URL to reflect their brand or content. This feature is particularly useful for individuals or small business who want to create branded links for their brands.
- QR Code Generation: CutFitt_URL allows users to also generate QR codes for the shortened URLs. Users can download the QR code image and use it in their promotional materials or/and on their website. This feature will be implemented using a third-party QR code generator API, which can be integrated into the CutFitt_URL platform.
- Analytics: CutFitt_URL provides basic analytics that allow users to track their shortened URL's performance. Users can see how many clicks their shortened URL has received and where the clicks are coming from.
